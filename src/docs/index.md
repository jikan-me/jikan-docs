# Welcome to JikanDocs

!!! info
    This documentation is for Jikan **2.0.0 RC1**. For v1.x, refer [here](https://jikan.moe/old-docs).

Jikan is an __unofficial__ [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net) PHP API. It does **not** require any authentication and parses the data via scraping. It provides what the official API lacks.


The raison d'être of Jikan is to help developers easily get the data they need for their apps and projects without having to depend on the lackluster official API, unstable APIs, or sidetracking their projects to develop parsers.

The word Jikan literally translates to Time in Japanese (時間). And that's what this API saves you of.

## REST API
If you're not interested in using the PHP API, a REST API service as available as well.
